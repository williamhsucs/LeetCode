/**
 * The conditions are:
 *  - This tree is a binary search tree.
 *  - At least one node.
 *  - The k value is smaller than the number of nodes.
 * 
 * List some examples:
 * 
 *          3               3         1
 *         / \     |       /     |
 *        1   4    |      2      |
 *         \       |     /       |
 *          2      |    1        |
 *                 |   /
 *                    0
 * 
 * Think aloud:
 *  - This is a typical problem of finding a specific node. 
 *    I prefer to use DFS to solve this problem.
 *  - Because a valid BSTâ€™s left child is always smaller than its parent node, 
 *    and the parent node is always smaller than its right child. 
 *    So, I will use in-order traversal to traverse the tree.
 *  - Use a variable to record the traversal history. 
 *    When the value of this variable is equal to k, 
 *    return the value of the current node.
